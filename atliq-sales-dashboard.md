<a href="https://www.loom.com/share/2da1b93c71d94ae6acb57a79670b9886" target="_blank">View Dashboard</a>

**What I used**

- Import data to Excel using .csv files.
- Used Power Query Edtior for data transforming and Load data to model.
- Created table by using PivotTable.
- Created measures (SUM, CALCULATE, DIVIDE) for calculation.

**Summary**

- India generated highest net sales compared to other markets and increased significantly from $30.8M in 2019 to $161.3M in 2021.
- For APAC region, although net sales increase, gross margin % decreased from 36.11% to 35.29%.
- Net sales from EU region increased from $39.0M in 2020 to 139.7M in 2021. Especially net sales generated from United Kingdom increased from $8.1M in 2020 to $34.2M in 2021.
- Retailers are the highest net sales channel for AtliQ compared to Direct or Distributor, however, most of those sales are generated by retailers in India.

**Recommendation**

- Optimize Cost Of Good Solds (COGS) in APAC region to increase gross margin.
- Focus more in EU region, especially United Kingdom market because it showed potential to increase more in net sales compared to other market.
- Working with retailers of other regions and markets to find a solution to increase net sales and gross margin.
