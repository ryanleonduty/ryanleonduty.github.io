### Excel: AtliQ Sales Dashboard

In this project, I built a dashboard to visualize net sales for 3 financial years 2019, 2020, and 2021. 

**Summary**

1. India generated highest net sales compared to other markets and increased significantly from $30.8M in 2019 to $161.3M in 2021.
2. For APAC region, although net sales increase, gross margin % decreased from 36.11% to 35.29%.
3. Net sales from EU region increased from $39.0M in 2020 to 139.7M in 2021. Especially net sales generated from United Kingdom increased from $8.1M in 2020 to $34.2M in 2021.
4. Retailers are the highest net sales channel for AtliQ compared to Direct or Distributor, however, most of those sales are generated by retailers in India.

**Recommendation**

1. Optimize Cost Of Good Solds (COGS) in APAC region to increase gross margin.
2. Focus more in EU region, especially United Kingdom market because it showed potential to increase more in net sales compared to other market.
3. Working with retailers of other regions and markets to find a solution to increase net sales and gross margin.
